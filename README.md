# Smart_Cradle
The Smart Cradle System with Camera for Infants is an innovative project designed to enhance infant safety during sleep through advanced monitoring technology. This system integrates a camera with intelligent algorithms to continuously analyse the sleeping position and movements of infants in cradles. Real-time alerts are generated when irregularities or potential risks, such as accidental suffocation or improper positioning, are detected. The system provides parents or caregivers with timely notifications, allowing for prompt intervention and reducing the likelihood of sleep-related incidents.
Key features of this system include continuous monitoring capabilities, a robust alert system, and a user-friendly interface for accessing alerts and monitoring sleep patterns. By leveraging technology to improve infant safety during sleep, the Smart Cradle System aims to provide peace of mind to parents and caregivers. This proactive approach contributes to creating safer sleep environments for infants, ultimately promoting their well-being and reducing the risk of sleep-related issues.
Moreover, the system employs machine learning techniques to adapt and improve its monitoring accuracy over time. It can differentiate between normal and abnormal movements, ensuring that alerts are both precise and reliable. The user interface is designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy for parents to customize alert settings and review their child's sleep data.
The Smart Cradle System also includes a two-way audio feature, enabling parents to soothe their infants remotely. In addition, the system can integrate with other smart home devices, providing a comprehensive solution for modern parenting needs. Enhanced security measures ensure that the video feed and data are protected, maintaining the privacy of the family.
By combining cutting-edge technology with user-centric design, the Smart Cradle System offers a sophisticated solution to a critical aspect of infant care. It not only monitors but also educates parents about safe sleep practices, contributing to a broader understanding of infant health and safety.
The system is built using Python and OpenCV, leveraging machine learning algorithms for real-time analysis. The Raspberry Pi Camera Module and Raspberry Pi 3 serve as the hardware backbone, providing reliable and efficient performance. The camera module captures high-resolution video, while the Raspberry Pi 3 processes the data using pre-trained machine learning models. This combination ensures that the system operates smoothly and effectively, delivering real-time monitoring and alert capabilities.
The integration of these technologies allows the Smart Cradle System to function autonomously, continuously learning and adapting to improve its detection accuracy. Parents can access the system remotely via a mobile app or web interface, receiving instant notifications and accessing live video feeds. This comprehensive approach ensures that infants are monitored around the clock, providing parents with the assurance that their child is safe and secure.
